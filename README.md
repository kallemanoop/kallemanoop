## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anoop. I work with data, advanced neural nets and linguistics, and code that actually do something useful. Right now Iâ€™m doing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at the University of Maryland. Most of my time goes into building, testing, and breaking down machine learning systems so I can figure out how to make them better.

I work mostly in Python. Iâ€™ve built LLM-based systems using LangChain, LangGraph, HuggingFace APIs, Together AI, and Groq. Iâ€™ve used models like LLaMA3, Gemma2, Mixtral, and Exaone in actual deployments, not just toy setups. Iâ€™ve worked with RAG pipelines, multi-model inference, and streamlining LLM interaction using tools like ChromaDB and Streamlit.

Outside of that, Iâ€™ve built things with PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Flask, FastAPI, and handled deployments using Git, MLflow, DVC, and S3. Iâ€™m comfortable working with real data, from cleaning and processing it with Pandas and NumPy, to pushing models into production using CI/CD and GitHub Actions.

Some of my recent work includes:
- A chatbot system for museums that handles bookings using GenAI and RAG
- An agentic personal assistant that runs multiple LLMs in parallel
- A research project testing how LLMs handle high pressure moral dilemmas and contrasting their divergent behaviour with humans' cognitive abilities - digging into what they choose, why they choose it, and how it all plays out under stress.

I care about writing clean, efficient code and solving real problems without overcomplicating things. Thatâ€™s it.
